# Quantum Inspired Machine Learning Approaches For Representation Learning and Compression

This repository presents two novel quantum-inspired machine learning models for classifying classical data by representing it as quantum Hamiltonians. The methods, based on the principles of the Adiabatic Theorem and the Quantum Anharmonic Oscillator, offer a new paradigm for data representation and classification.


## Motivation

Classical data, such as images, can be viewed as matrices. By interpreting these matrices as Hamiltonians—the operators that describe the total energy of a quantum system—we can leverage powerful concepts from quantum mechanics to develop unique and efficient learning algorithms. This work explores this concept, aiming to create more compact data representations and robust classifiers.

## Implementation Details

The code is written using Pytorch framework.
